FinancialWorksheets
===================

This is a very simple collection of various spreadsheets I have developed while doing my
personal finances. (Yes, I use macro-laden spreadsheets on a daily basis to manage my
money. :-P )

The term "Debt Snowball" might actually belong to Dave Ramsey. The spreadsheet is 
definitely based on Ramsey's concept of a "debt snowball", which is essentially a
waterfall of money into various accounts. (Pay one off completely before continuing to pay
off the next.)
